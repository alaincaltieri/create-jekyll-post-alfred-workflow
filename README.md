# Create Jekyll Post -- A Simple Alfred Workflow

This is a simple workflow to create a Jekyll post with Front Matter. I use it to write new posts for [Your Financial Fallacies](https://financialfallacies.com/).

## How to configure

1. Download the `.alfredworkflow` file.
2. Double click it to add it to your workflows. Set the correct destinantion path.
3. Edit the `vpost` step to add your own categories.
4. Edit the `Open file` step to set a default markdown editor.
5. Change icons in the `post` and `vpost` steps.

You can change the posts path later in the Workflow configuration by tapping `[x]`.

## How to use

In the Alfred's Search bar, type `post` and the article's title.

```
post Money can buy happiness
```

Then select a category. This field auto-completes as you type. To display all available categories, press spacebar.


## Support multiple blogs

Simply duplicate the workflow in Alfred. Make only sure to set a new icon to the `post` and `vpost` steps, so that you can easily identify which blog you're posting to.

Then change the proper parameters as explained in How to configure.


## Credits

The starting point for this workflow is the **Simple To-Do List** Example in Alfred.

Default images and categories are from [Your Financial Fallacies](https://financialfallacies.com/). 

You can use this work as you like.
